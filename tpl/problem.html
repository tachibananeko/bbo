    <div class="title">WHAT IS PROBLEM GAMBLING?</div>
    <div class="problem__txt01">
        <img src="../images/img_problem.jpg">
        <p>PROBLEM GAMBLING is an urge to continuously gamble despite harmful negative consequences or a desire to stop. It is
        often defined by whether harm is experienced by the gambler or others, rather than by the gambler’s behavior. A gambling
        behavior that causes disruptions in any major area of life: psychological, physical, social, or vocational.</p>
